	        <p><strong>AI Subsets: Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Machine learning</strong>, a subset of AI, refers to a machineâ€™s ability to think without being externally programmed. Machine learning allows devices to learn directly from the data itself and become more intelligent over time as more data is collected. </p>
			<p><strong>Deep learning</strong>, a subset of machine learning, is a machine learning technique that uses multiple neural network layers to progressively extract higher level features from the raw input data.</p>

	        <p><strong>Types of AI: Strong AI vs. Weak AI</strong></p>
			<p>AI can be categorized as either weak or strong.</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>Weak AI</li>
			    Narrow AI, or weak AI, has a narrow range of abilities, operating within a limited context. Narrow AI is goal-oriented and designed to perform singular, specific tasks, 
			    such as facial recognition and speech recognition/voice assistants (i.e. Appleâ€™s Siri).
			    <p></p>
			    <li>Strong AI</li>
			    Strong AI, or Artificial general intelligence (AGI), is the concept of a machine that mimics human intelligence and/or behaviors, with the ability to learn and apply its intelligence to solve any problem. 
			    AGI can think, understand, and respond as a human would in a particular situation.
